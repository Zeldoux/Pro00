This project is a personal endeavor aimed at enhancing my development journey.
It's a fully functional website with a backend server that I host myself.
The primary goal is to provide a versatile platform offering several useful features to users.

The website will encompass several key features :
#1 Functional Account System: Users can create an account and access all site features once logged in.
#2 Coding Space: An interactive coding space will allow users to code directly on the website, import/export, and share their code.
#3 File Upload/Download Systems: Each user will be able to upload or share files on the site, whether for sharing with other users or for personal backup.
#4 JavaScript Video Games: A continuously evolving MMORPG JavaScript video game, with graphics inspired by Zelda/Pok√©mon, aiming to support up to 100 players.
#5 Account Statistics: Users will have access to various statistics such as time spent on the site, files downloaded/uploaded, usage of the coding space, etc.
#6 Integrated Chat: A chat feature will enable users to communicate directly on the site.
#7 Potential Forum: An optional forum option that can contain a variety of topics.

The program is structured in steps to facilitate development: 

1/ build the Front-end part of the website(without media queries) :

  * Mockups: Create mockups or wireframes to visualize the layout and design of each page.

2/ build the back-end part of the website :

  * Database: Set up the database structure to store user account information, uploaded files, game data, and any other necessary data.
  * Server Host: Choose a hosting provider and set up the server environment to host the website and database.
  * Server Configuration: Configure the server software (e.g., Apache, Nginx) and any necessary server-side scripts or APIs to handle requests and interact with the database.
    
3/ Build media queries for mobiles/iPad :

  * Pad (Tablet): Implement media queries to ensure that the website layout and design are optimized for iPads and other tablet devices.
  * Mobiles (Phones): Implement media queries to ensure that the website layout and design are optimized for mobile phones and other small-screen devices.
    
4/ build the Coding space :

  * Support Different Languages: Develop the coding space feature, including a text editor with syntax highlighting and support for multiple programming languages.
    
5/ build the upload/download Front-end--back-end relation : 

  * Implement the front-end interface for uploading and downloading files, and establish the necessary back-end functionality to handle file storage and retrieval.
6/ build the account stats front-end--back-end relation :

  * Implement the front-end interface for displaying account statistics, such as time spent on the site, files uploaded/downloaded, etc...
  * establish the necessary back-end functionality to retrieve and calculate these statistics.
    
/7 build functional upload/download system and stats account systems :
  * Test and refine the upload/download system and account statistics functionality to ensure that they are fully functional and user-friendly.

/8 build functional Website Chat systems :
  * Implement a chat system that allows users to communicate with each other in real-time, and ensure that it is integrated smoothly with the rest of the website.

/9 build the javascript Game :

  * Build Server Part: Develop the server-side components of the game, including any necessary APIs or backend logic for managing game data and player interactions.
  * Build Gameplay Part: Develop the client-side components of the game, including the game engine, graphics, user interface, and any other gameplay features.
    
/10 build a Forum Website part (optional) :
